Original was STRIPS domain, adaption uses quantification over all screws in precondititions, to allow for a flexible number of those. For a number of fridges, unfasten the screws holding the backplane, then remove the backplanes and exchange the broken compressor with a new one, then re-assemble the fridge and turn it on.',
