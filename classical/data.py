# General domain descriptions to populate the database
domain_description = {
    'airport': 'Developed by Jorg Hoffmann and Sebastian Trug. Planners control the ground traffic on airports. The competition test suites were generated by exporting traffic situations arising during simulation runs in the airport simulation tool Astras (by Wolfgang Hatzack). The largest instances in the test suites are realistic encodings of Munich airport.',
    'assembly': 'The goal is to assemble a complex object made out of subassemblies. The sequence of steps must obey a given partial order. In addition, through poor engineering design, many subassemblies must be installed temporarily in one assembly, then removed and given a permanent home in another. This domain was created by Drew McDermott.',
    'barman': 'In this domain there is a robot barman that manipulates drink dispensers, glasses and a shaker. The goal is to find a plan of the robots actions that serves a desired set of drinks. In this domain deletes of actions encode relevant knowledge given that robot hands can only grasp one object at a time and given that glasses need to be empty and clean to be filled.',
    'blocks': 'The blocks world is one of the most famous planning domains in artificial intelligence. Imagine a set of cubes (blocks) sitting on a table. The goal is to build one or more vertical stacks of blocks. The catch is that only one block may be moved at a time: it may either be placed on the table or placed atop another block. Because of this, any blocks that are, at a given time, under another block cannot be moved.',
    'cavediving': 'There are a set of divers, each of who can carry 4 tanks of air. These divers must be hired to go into an underwater cave and either take photos or prepare the way for other divers by dropping full tanks of air. The cave is too narrow for more than one diver to enter at a time. The cave system is represented by an undirected acyclic graph. Divers have a single point of entry. Certain leaf nodes of the cave branches are objectives that the divers must photograph. Swimming and photographing both consume air tanks. Divers must exit the cave and decompress at the end. They can therefore only make a single trip into the cave. Certain divers have no confidence in other divers and will refuse to work if someone they have no confidence in has already worked. Divers have hiring costs inversely proportional to how hard they are to work with.',
    'childsnack': 'This domain is to plan how to make and serve sandwiches for a group of children in which some are allergic to gluten. There are two actions for making sandwiches from their ingredients. The first one makes a sandwich and the second one makes a sandwich taking into account that all ingredients are gluten-free. There are also actions to put a sandwich on a tray and to serve sandwiches. Problems in this domain define the ingredients to make sandwiches at the initial state. Goals consist of having all kids served with a sandwich to which they are not allergic.',
    'citycar': 'This model aims to simulate the impact of road building / demolition on traffic flows. A city is represented as an acyclic graph, in which each node is a junction and edges are "potential" roads. Some cars start from different positions and have to reach their final destination as soon as possible. The agent has a finite number of roads available, which can be built for connecting two junctions and allowing a car to move between them. Roads can also be removed, and placed somewhere else, if needed. In order to place roads or to move cars, the destination junction must be clear, i.e., no cars should be in there.',
    'cybersec': 'A domain that models the cyber security model of vulnerability analysis for cyber defense.',
    'depot': 'This domain was devised in order to see what would happen if two previously well-researched domains were joined together. These were the logistics and blocks domains. They are combined to form a domain in which trucks can transport crates around and then the crates must be stacked onto pallets at their destinations. The stacking is achieved using hoists, so the stacking problem is like a blocks-world problem with hands. Trucks can behave like "tables", since the pallets on which crates are stacked are limited.',
    'driverlog': 'This domain involves driving trucks around delivering packages between locations. The complication is that the trucks require drivers who must walk between trucks in order to drive them. The paths for walking and the roads for driving form different maps on the locations.',
    'elevators': 'The scenario is the following: There is a building with N+1 floors, numbered from 0 to N. The building can be separated in blocks of size M+1, where M divides N. Adjacent blocks have a common floor. For example, suppose N=12 and M=4, then we have 13 floors in total (ranging from 0 to 12), which form 3 blocks of 5 floors each, being 0 to 4, 4 to 8 and 8 to 12. The building has K fast (accelarating) elevators that stop only in floors that are multiple of M/2 (so M has to be an even number). Each fast elevator has a capacity of X persons. Furthermore, within each block, there are L slow elevators, that stop at every floor of the block. Each slow elevator has a capacity of Y persons (usually Y<X). There are costs associated with each elavator starting/stoping and moving. In particular, fast (accelarating) elevators have negligible cost of starting/stoping but have significant cost while moving. On the other hand, slow (constant speed) elevators have significant cost when starting/stoping and negligible cost while moving. Travelling times between floors are given for any type of elevator, taking into account the constant speed of the slow elevators and the constant acceleration of the fast elevators. There are several passengers, for which their current location (i.e. the floor they are) and their destination are given. The planning problem is to find a plan that moves the passengers to their destinations while minimizing the total cost of moving the passengers to their destinations . The total cost is increased each time an elevator starts/stops or moves.',
    'floortile': 'A set of robots use different colors to paint patterns in floor tiles. The robots can move around the floor tiles in four directions (up, down, left and right). Robots paint with one color at a time, but can change their spray guns to any available color. However, robots can only paint the tile that is in front (up) and behind (down) them, and once a tile has been painted no robot can stand on it. For the IPC set, robots need to paint a grid with black and white, where the cell color is alternated always. This particular configuration makes the domain hard because robots should only paint tiles in front of them, since painting tiles behind make the search to reach a dead-end.',
    'freecell': 'Freecell is the familiar solitaire game found on many computers, involving moving cards from an initial tableau, constrained by tight restrictions, to achieve a final suit-sorted collection of stacks.',
    'ged': 'The GED problem is to find a min-cost sequence of operations that transforms one genome (signed permutation of genes) into another. The purpose of this is to use this cost as a measure of the distance between the two genomes, which is used to construct hypotheses about the evolutionary relationship between the organisms.',
    'grid': 'There is a square grid of locations. A robot can move one grid square at a time horizontally and vertically. If a square is locked, the robot can move to it only by unlocking it, which requires having a key of the same shape as the lock. The goal is to get keys from various locations to various new locations. This domain was created by Jana Koehler, based on an earlier domain by Drew McDermott.',
    'gripper': 'There is a robot with two grippers. It can carry a ball in each. The goal is to take N balls from one room to another; N rises with problem number. Some planners treat the two grippers asymmetrically, giving rise to an unnecessary combinatorial explosion. This domain was created by Jana Koehler.',
    'hiking': 'Imagine you want to walk with your partner a long clockwise circular route over several days (e.g. in the "Lake District" in NW England), and you do one "leg" each day. You want to start at a certain point and do the walk in one direction, without ever walking backwards. You have two cars which you must use to carry your tent/luggage and to carry you and your partner to the start/end of a leg, if necessary. Driving a car between any two points is allowed, but walking must be done with your partner and must start from the place where you left off. As you will be tired when you have walked to the end of a leg, you must have your tent up ready there so you can sleep the night before you set off to do the next leg the morning.',
    'logistics': 'There are several cities, each containing several locations, some of which are airports. There are also trucks, which can drive within a single city, and airplanes, which can fly between airports. The goal is to get some packages from various locations to various new locations. This domain was created by Bart Selman and Henry Kautz, based on an earlier domain by Manuela Veloso.',
    'maintenance': 'This is a simple planning/scheduling problem. There are mechanics/equipment who on any day may work at one of several airports (hubs) where the maintenance facilities are present. There are airplanes each of which has to be checked or repaired during the given time period. The airplanes are guaranteed to visit some of the airports on given days. The problem is to schedule the presence of the mechanics/equipment so that each plane will get maintenance once during the time period.',
    'miconic': 'A domain that models the problem of elevator control. Originally introduced by Jana Koehler and Kilian Schuster from Schindler Lifts  Ltd.',
    'movie': 'In this domain, the goal is always the same (to have lots of snacks in order to watch a movie), but the number of constants increases with problem number. Some planners have combinatorial problems in such cases. This domain was created by Corin Anderson.',
    'mprime': 'This is the mystery domain with one extra action, the ability to squirt a unit of fuel from any node to a neighboring node, provided the originating node has at least two units. Created by Drew McDermott',
    'mystery': 'There is a planar graph of nodes. At each node are vehicles, cargo items, and some amount of fuel. Objects can be loaded onto vehicles (up to their capacity), and the vehicles can move between nodes; but a vehicle can leave a node only if there is a nonzero amount of fuel there, and the amount decreases by one unit. The goal is to get cargo items from various nodes to various new nodes. To disguise the domain, the nodes were called emotions, the cargo items were pains, the vehicles were pleasures, and fuel and capacity numbers were encoded as geographical entities. This domain was created by Drew McDermott.',
    'no-mprime': 'This is the mystery domain with one extra action, the ability to squirt a unit of fuel from any node to a neighboring node, provided the originating node has at least two units. Created by Drew McDermott',
    'no-mystery': 'Nomystery is a transportation domain designed to study resource constrained planning. In this domain, a truck moves in a weighted graph; a set of packages must be transported between nodes; actions move along edges, and load/unload packages; each move consumes the edge weight in fuel. In brief, Nomystery is a straightforward problem similar to the ones contained in many IPC benchmarks. Its key feature is that it comes with a domain-specific optimal solver allowing to control the constrainedness of the resources. The generator first creates a random connected undirected graph with n nodes, and it adds k packages with random origins and destinations. The edge weights are uniformly drawn between 1 and an integer W. The optimal solver computes the minimum required amount of fuel M, and the initial fuel supply is set to [C xM], where C >=1 is a (float) input parameter of the generator. The parameter C denotes the ratio between the available fuel vs. the minimum amount required. The problem becomes more constrained when C approaches 1.',

    'openstacks': 'The openstacks domain is based on the "minimum maximum simultaneous open stacks" combinatorial optimization problem, which can be stated as follows: A manufacturer has a number of orders, each for a combination of different products, and can only make one product at a time. The total required quantity of each product is made at the same time (because changing from making one product to making another requires a production stop). From the time that the first product included in an order is made to the time that all products included in the order have been made, the order is said to be "open" and during this time it requires a "stack" (a temporary storage space). The problem is to order the making of the different products so that the maximum number of stacks that are in use simultaneously, or equivalently the number of orders that are in simultaneous production, is minimized (because each stack takes up space in the production area).',
    'optical-telegraphs': 'Developed by Stefan Edelkamp. Planners are asked to find deadlocks in communication protocols, translated into PDDL from the Promela specification language. Deadlocks were specified via blocked transitions and processes. The representation chosen for the processes are finite state transition systems, while communication channels are modelled by queues with moving head and tail pointers. The communication protocols used in IPC-4 were the dining philosophers problem, as well as an optical telegraph routing problem.',
    'parcprinter': 'This domain models the operation of the multi-engine printer, for which one prototype is developed at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). This type of printer can handle multiple print jobs simultaneously. Multiple sheets, belonging to the same job or different jobs, can be printed simultaneously using multiple Image Marking Engines (IME). Each IME can either be color, which can print both color and black&white images, or mono, which can only print black&white image. Each sheet needs to go through multiple printer components such as feeder, transporter, IME, inverter, finisher and need to arrive at the finisher in order. Thus, sheet (n+1) needs to be stacked in the same finisher with sheet n of the same job, but needs to arrive at the finisher right after sheet n (no other sheet stacked in between those two consecutive sheets). Given that the IMEs are heterogeneous (mixture of color and mono) and can run at different speeds, optimizing the operation of this printer for a mixture of print jobs, each of them is an arbitrary mixture of color/b&w pages that are either simplex (one-sided print) or duplex (two-sided print) is a hard problem.',
    'parking': 'This domain is original from the learning part of IPC2008. The domain involves parking cars on a street with N curb locations, and where cars can be double-parked but not triple-parked. The goal is to find a plan to move from one configuration of parked cars to another configuration, by driving cars from one curb location to another. The problems in the competition contain 2*(N-1) cars, which allows one free curb space and guarantees solvability.',
    'pathways': 'Finding a sequence of biochemical (pathways) reactions in an organism producing certain substances.',
    'pathways-noneg': 'Finding a sequence of biochemical (pathways) reactions in an organism producing certain substances.',
    'pegsol': 'This domain models the Peg Solitaire game. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire)',
    'philosophers': 'Developed by Stefan Edelkamp. Planners are asked to find deadlocks in communication protocols, translated into PDDL from the Promela specification language.

    'pipesworld': 'Developed by Frederico Liporace and Jorg Hoffmann. Planners control the flow of oil derivatives through a pipeline network, obeying various constraints such as product compatibility, tankage restrictions, and (in the most complex domain version) goal deadlines. One interesting aspect of the domain is that, if one inserts something into the one end of a pipeline segment, something potentially completely different comes out at the other end. This gives rise to several subtle phenomena that can arise in the creation of a plan.',
    'pipesworld-notankage': 'Developed by Frederico Liporace and Jorg Hoffmann.

    'psr-large': 'Developed by Sylvie Thiebaux and Jorg Hoffmann. Planners must resupply a number of lines in a faulty electricity network. The flow of electricity through the network, at any point in time, is given by a transitive closure over the network connections, subject to the states of the switches and electricity supply devices. The domain is therefore a good example of the usefulness of derived predicates in real-world applications.',
    'psr-middle': 'Developed by Sylvie Thiebaux and Jorg Hoffmann. Planners must resupply a number of lines in a faulty electricity network.

    'rovers': 'Inspired by planetary rovers problems, this domain requires that a collection of rovers navigate a planet surface, finding samples and communicating them back to a lander.',
    'satellite': 'The first of the domains inspired by space-applications is a first step towards the "Ambitious Spacecraft" described by David Smith at AIPS-2000. It involves planning and scheduling a collection of observation tasks between multiple satellites, each equipped in slightly different ways.',
    'scanalyzer': 'This domain models the problem of automatic greenhouse logistic management.',
    'schedule': 'Encodes a simple Scheduling kind of problem where a number of objects need to be processed using a collection of machines. Possible actions are polishing, punching holes, painting etc. All actions need uniform time, which is modelled by a do-time-step operator. If that operator is applied, then all busy machines are no longer busy, and all scheduled objects are no longer scheduled---this is also an example of the kind of conditional effects that are used in the representation.',
    'settlers': 'This one was for the numeric track and proved to be a very tough resource management domain. Several interesting issues in encoding arise as well as the subsequent problem of planning with the domain. In particular, resources can be combined to construct vehicles of various kinds. Since these vehicles are not available initially, this is an example of a problem in which new objects are created. PDDL does not conveniently support this concept at present, so it is necessary to name "potential" vehicles at the outset, which can be realised through construction. A very high degree of redundant symmetry exists between these "potential" vehicles, since it does not matter which vehicle names are actually used for the vehicles that are realised in a plan. Planners that begin by grounding all actions can be swamped by the large numbers of potential actions involving these potential vehicles, which could be realised as one of several different types of actual vehicles. Plan quality is judged by a linear combination of labour use, pollution creation and resource consumption. There is scope for constructing very hard metrics that involve maximising housing construction subject to an increasing pollution penalty (say), to ensure that optimal plan quality is bounded.',
    'sokoban': 'This domain models the Sokoban game. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban)',
    'storage': 'Moving and storing crates of goods by hoists from containers to depots with spatial maps.',
    'tetris': 'This is a simplified version of the well-known Tetris. All the pieces (1x1, 2x1, L) are randomly distributed on a NxN grid. The goal is to move them in order to free the upper half of the grid. The pieces can be rotated or translated. Each movement action has a different cost, accordingly to the size of the piece.',
    'thoughtful': 'This domain is original from the learning part of IPC2008. The domain represents a well-known solitaire card game.',
    'tidybot': 'The Tidybot domain models a household cleaning task, in which one or more robots must pick up a set of objects and put them into goal locations. The world is structured as a 2d grid, divided into navigable locations and surfaces on which objects may lie. Robots have a gripper, which moves relative to the robot, up to some maximum radius. Existing objects block the gripper, so that it may be necessary to move one object out of the way to put another one down. Robots can carry one object at a time in the gripper, but may also make use of a cart, that can hold multiple objects. The instance generator creates worlds that contain rectangular surfaces ("tables"), as well as U-shaped enclosures ("cupboards"), which are the goal locations of objects.',
    'tpp': 'Traveling and buying goods at selected markets minimizing costs (from OR with variants, NP-hard).',
    'transport': 'Each vehicle can transport some packages depending on its capacity and moving has a cost depending on the length of the road. Picking up or dropping a package costs 1.',
    'trucks': 'Moving packages between locations by trucks under certain spatial constraints and delivering deadlines.',
    'visitall': 'An agent in the middle of a square grid nxn must visit all the cells in the grid. Solving optimally the delete relaxation h+ gives the exact goal distance as long as there exists a hamiltonian path visiting every cell. Recall that in a 1xn grid, no hamiltonian path exists.',
    'woodworking': 'Simulates the works in a woodworking workshop where there is some quantity of wood that has to be polished, coloured, etc. using different tools with different costs. Parameters of each problem are the parts to be done and the quantity (in % of necessary) of available wood (boards). The higher the number of parts and the boards the more difficult the problem is.',
    'zenotravel': 'The zenotravel domain involves transporting people around in planes, using different modes of movement: fast and slow. The key to this domain is that, where the expressive power of the numeric tracks is used, the fast movement consumes fuel faster than slow movement, making the search for a good quality plan (one using less fuel) much harder.'
